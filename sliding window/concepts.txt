iyion for variable size window
Initialization:

1. Start with two pointers, i (left) and j (right), both initialized to the start of the array.
Maintain a windowSum to keep track of the sum of elements within the current window.
Keep track of the minimum length of the subarray that meets the condition.
Expanding the Window:

2. Increment j to expand the window by including more elements and adding them to windowSum.
Shrinking the Window:

3. When the windowSum meets or exceeds the target, update the minimum length and then shrink the window from the left by incrementing i and subtracting arr[i] from windowSum.
Repeat:

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the array is reached.

//genral tempalte condition can be anything;
 
 //updated result can be anything.
 //based on your question;

function variableSizeSlidingWindow(arr, condition) {
    let result = someInitialValue;
    let windowSum = 0;
    let i = 0;

    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
        windowSum += arr[j];

        // Modify the condition and the update steps as needed
        while (condition(windowSum)) {
            result = updateResult(result, j - i + 1, windowSum);
            windowSum -= arr[i];
            i++;
        }
    }

    return finalResult(result);
}

// Example condition and update functions for a specific problem
function condition(windowSum) {
    return windowSum >= target;
}

function updateResult(result, currentLength, windowSum) {
    return Math.min(result, currentLength);
}

function finalResult(result) {
    return result === Infinity ? 0 : result;
}
